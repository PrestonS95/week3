SNAKE
As a user playing the game I want to:

start the game by pressing a Start button
use my arrow keys to change the direction of the snake
have the snake grow correctly when it eats the apple
have the game end if the snake tries to eat itself
have the game end if the snake runs into a wall
see how long my snake was when the game ended
start the game over without having to reset the browser


As a user playing the game I would be delighted if I:

can set the difficulty (speed of snake)
can keep track of my stats (maximum points, average points, etc.) between games



//Need to make the game board out of a grid of rows and columns 20x20
//Need to have a game loop, automatically move the snake forward the same direction   as last loop, unless interrupted by player key input.
//Need to check for collision of snake with wall, itself, food, and empty space each loop.
//Need to add a length to snake tail if food is collided with.
